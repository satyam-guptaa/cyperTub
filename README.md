video streaming application created using dummy JSON but fetches the data just like an async api call.
created using react, sass it is purely self made, the figma design is provided by frontendmentor.io
this application can be viewed here https://enter10ment-bysatyam.netlify.app/ , apologies if any page not found issue occurs will keep checking netlify to keep the application running.
I aspire to make this a full stack application in future using Node, Mongo, Express.
